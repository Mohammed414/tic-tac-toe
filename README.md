## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way for users to play the classic tic-tac-toe game. The project aims to showcase fundamental web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What I learned

I learned organizing my code using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) and the module pattern. I also learned how to use the revealing module pattern to expose certain methods and variables to the global scope while keeping the rest of the code private using closures.

## Features

- Interactive user interface
- Game logic
- Game reset

## Setup

To run the project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

To start a new game, open the project in a web browser and take turns with another player to mark the grid until there's a winner or a draw.
